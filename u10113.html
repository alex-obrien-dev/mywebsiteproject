<h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? </h2>

<div class="answersBody">
<p>For this project I will be planning and designing my own website. I will do this in a series of phases to ensure the best possible outcome and end products.</p>
<p>The first thing I do is sat up a Trello board to ensure efficiency of the project and to help me plan and execute it. The Kanban method allows to me split the project into tasks, from the planning process to the closing down of project. This gives me an overview of my project and helps me keep on track without missing anything.</p>
<p>To avoid failure right from the start I need to be clear and on the purpose of my website. Along with this I will want to clearly define my expectations and goals for this website. </p>
<p>The next stage is to ensure I have the right resources and create a budget if relevant. This will tie into my goals and ensure I have the right tools to succeed.</p>
<p>The main component of your website is obviously your content, at this stage I will create a content strategy to decide what information I’d like to give to any viewers, whether it be blog posts, documents, pictures or anything else.</p>
<p>Once I know the content strategy, I can start to structure the website, deciding on features and the navigation of the website.</p>
<p>Now I can begin to make a wireframe for my website using a design program. This will give me an idea of how I want the website to look before I start to build. When I’m happy I will start building the website using visual studio to write the HTML and CSS, keeping a strong focus of both the usability and the aesthetics of the website to ensure the best possible experience for visitors.</p>
<p>Once its built, the last stage is to thoroughly test the website out and then ensure I have a plan for any future required maintenance.</p>
