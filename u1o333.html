    <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time?</h2>
    <div>
        <p>After looking back at this project and looking at its strengths and weaknesses I have identified problems and solution that I can carry on improving the outcomes of future IT and digital projects. I would definitely seek to increase my training and knowledge and research tools and systems that would best fit the new project. Also, where relevant I would assemble a team with skills required to ensure strength, quality, and efficiency in every task within the project.</p>
