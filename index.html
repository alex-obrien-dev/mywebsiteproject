            <p>My name is Alexander Oâ€™Brien and I am a Technical Consultant for CodeAcademy</p>
            <p>
            Although my professional background is not in tech, I have always had a passion for it and every time I see something, I wonder how its built. My brain has always excelled with science and mathematics for as long as I can remember with my focus at college being maths, further maths and economics. When learning programming I realised I could apply this and my learning accelerated as did my enjoyment and passion.

            I currently live in Manchester where I like to spend the majority of my time either going to gigs, socialising and doing a lot of outdoors including; hiking, bouldering, skateboarding and surfing (whenever I actually find time to make it to the coast!).
