<h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<div class="answersBody">
    <p>The General Data Protection Regulation was first introduced on the 25th May 2018. Its purpose is that standardised a wide range of privacy legislations across the EU into one central set of regulations protecting users in all member states. The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors, and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.</p>
    <p>Under the GDPR, individuals have 8 basic rights:</p>
    <li>1.   The right to access. <br>
        2.	The right to be forgotten. <br>
        3.	The right to data. <br>
        4.	The right to be informed. <br>
        5.	The right to have information correcte. <br>
        6.	The right to restrict processing.<br>
        7.	The right to object <br>
        8.	The right to be notified.<br>
        </p>
        <p>This impacts any companies and digital projects that have customers and it affects everyone inside the company. Companies must build privacy setting into digital products and website and having it switched on by default. They must also conduct privacy impact assessments, strengthen ways to seek permission, document how they use personal data and also constantly seek to improve communication of data breaches. This is legally binding and failure to comply can lead to fines of up to €20 million or 4% of your global turnover.</p>
        <p>As you can see this is not something to take lightly and digital projects will need to take this in to account in all phases of the project to be compliant. This increase the workload and you will most likely have to assign a data controller to the project to ensure all guidelines and constraints are met</p>
        <p>Furthermore for every business whether or not it be a new project and whether or not its digital the follow legal factors apply.</p>
        <p>Consumer law<br>
            Discrimination law<br>
            Copyright law<br>
            Health and Safety law<br>
            Employment law<br>
            Fraud law<br>
            Pyramid scheme legality<br>
            Import/Export law<br>
