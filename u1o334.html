    <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Testing digital solutions Can be done either by alpha or beta testing. Alpha testing is done in-house or in this case my myself personally, I would have to trial the solution to see if it has the desired effect, whether this be changing the layout, coding or content or even the way I manage the projects as a whole. The other method would be beta testing, which is done by someone else, in a business environment this may done by a third-party you pay to test or you could simply ask someone else. In terms of this project it is strictly testing myself and asking for guidance from my manager/tutor if needed.
