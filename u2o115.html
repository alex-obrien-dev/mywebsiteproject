    <div class="answersBody">
        <p>In this day and age, the internet has a massive impact in the way we conduct trade and communicate with the rest of the world. Anybody can create a website but here are certain constraints that should accounted for.</p>
        <p>The Copyright Act is an important one, this provides protection to any literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, film or broadcast work that falls with within the Actâ€™s definition of originality when it was created. This means the creator of th original work has exclusive rights for it use and distribution. This protection is automatic and no formal registration of the copyrighted work is required. This is most likely to exist in any text, pictures used videos used on a website so due diligence should be done on any content you publish on your website that is not your own original work.</p>
        <p>There are also numerous Consumer Laws designed to product consumers and others when online. These laws must be followed when setting up and running a website. These laws include - Accessibility requirements, GDPR, E-Marketing Law, E-Commerce Law, Cookies.</p>
