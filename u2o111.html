    <h2>Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
    <div class="answersBody">
        <p>The website consists of a home/index page which is an introduction to the website and also to me. From there is a navigation bar for each outcome with link boxes for each subject within that outcome, I preferred this way rather than having one long page for each outcome with endless amounts of writing. I find it less intimidating to read and visually more appealing. The fonts I chose are simple yet stylish, making for easy reading. The background images are all my own taken from my own camera, taken when hiking which is one of my passions.</p>
