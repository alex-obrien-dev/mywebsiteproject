    <h2>Descibe the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
    <div class="answersBody">
    <p>
        In today’s digital age IT has grown to be an integral part of modern business, regardless of the size of business or the industry. Some may view the IT department as what you see on the British sitcom ‘The IT Crowd’ where they sit in a dingy basement office and only surface to fix your computer. This is obviously not the case and IT’s role in companies is constantly growing with increased influence over a lot of business decisions and strategies.</p>
        <p>
        It’s worth noting that if you look at the day to day running of a business, whether it be; </p>
        <br>Communications both internal with staff and project teams or external with suppliers and       customers. This may be for example email, VoIP phones or website IM support.
        <br>
        Data storage which has changed a lot since having rooms and rooms of filing cabinets, instead it may be stored in the cloud or on a digital server where security is paramount and constant maintenance is needed.
        <br>
        Information management which tracks for example sales and expenses and can monitor activity. Furthermore, organising, and analysing data for business decisions and helping to boost productivity.
        <br>
        <p></p>These are some quick examples but there is massive amounts more and you can go in with a lot more depth. All these are maintained by IT and if any of these failed it would have a big detriment to the business, regardless again of the size or of the sector it is in.</p>
        <p>

        IT as we all know is constantly changing, updating, and improving. Meaning businesses are constantly investing in the best trained IT professionals available and the technology and software to increase productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of business decisions, operations and communication. For the foreseeable future the importance of Information Technology in business will continue in all aspect of the business, building the infrastructure that business relies on.</p>
