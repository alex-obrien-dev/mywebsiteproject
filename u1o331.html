    <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of  productivity and efficiency</h2>

    <div class="answersBody">
        <p>For this project it was just me that was involved in all phases. The tools and systems were absolutely fine, and I cannot think of any drawbacks. Are there more efficient tools and systems, most like yes, however I did not feel limited by the tools at hand. It is also worth noting that if I were doing this project as part of a team that there theoretically could be increased productivity and efficiency as we could assign team members to their strengths rather then having just me where i have strengths in some parts and weaknesses in other.</p>
