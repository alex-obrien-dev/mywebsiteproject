<h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
<div class="answersBody">
    <p>Whatever profession you are in and whether your self-employed or you are a large business, you naturally want to use the best software available.  But the term ‘best’ in itself is subjective; there is a vast amount of choice out there but the best option for you may not be the best for someone else.</p>
    <p>Whatever profession you are in and whether your self-employed or you are a large business, you naturally want to use the best software available.  But the term ‘best’ in itself is subjective; there is a vast amount of choice out there but the best option for you may not be the best for someone else.
        First and foremost, you should analyse your needs. You should not invest in IT systems just because its new and shiny and you most definitely have a budget. The main aim is to improve your productivity and work quality, benefiting both the business and the client/customer. Another important aspect is that ideally you want everything to integrate smoothly rather then having to switch platforms for different things which will cause can confusion and have an overall detrimental effect on your productivity and communication. It is also wise to do some intensive research before any purchase and consult with experts or the system manufacturers to make sure all your needs are covered. A big player in this decision is the budget, you may want to save money and buy cheap but it may all need replacing in a couple of years or you may fork out for more expensive system that will meet your needs for a longer period of time and pay for themselves in period. It is also noting that a lot of software in this age is now running subscription services which constantly update to the latest version as an option rather than buying a package that will be replaced by anew one which you’ll then have to purchase. There are a multitude of running costs to consider along with the initial purchase. Lastly after you have selected the It system for you or your business ensure that essential training is given for smooth operation.
