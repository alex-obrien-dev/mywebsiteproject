    <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
    <div class="answersBody">
        <p>As mention in other answers the key IT tools I used were Trello, Visual Studio Code and Slack. The term appropriate is subjective dependant on the project/task at hand. For this project, I have not had any difficulty with the tools and have not felt limited. With expectations set at the start I knew what was needed to achieve and was happy and currently still happy with these tools.
            Further information on the ongoing use of the tools can be read here.</p>
