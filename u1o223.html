            Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of this final project (this website that your viewing) there were notable point. My strength seemed to lie in creating the content itself although its worth noting writing has not always been a strong point. Furthermore, I am a meticulous planner which enables that the execution of the project was straight forward without distraction. With the content all planned and written and the website wire frame planned and written I could just get on and code the website without interruption. I noticed that I understood writing the code and was strong at building the elements and applying them. However, in terms of CSS I did struggle with getting to grips with the spacing and layout of the page which meant I had to devote more time to CSS for styling. This meant that although I am happy with the website and its content, I was hoping for more style and function ability as it does seem quite basic. With more time I could of done this this and this will be taken in to account for future projects.
