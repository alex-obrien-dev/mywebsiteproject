    <h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
    <div class="answersBody">
        <p>In terms of the current project which at this time of speaking is this website, the tools I have been using are Trello, Visual Studio Code and Slack.</p>
        <p>Trello has been necessary for the project as it is subject to time constraints with a deadline and must deliver a required amount of content. Trello lets me break up the project into individual tasks, order them by type of tasks like coding and content writing and also set deadlines on tasks. Trello has met all my needs for project management and gives me a constant visual overview of the projects progress.</p>
        <p>For the coding of HTML and CSS I have used Visual Studio Code, its worth noting this software is free and I am aware there are paid alternatives which may have been more time efficient. I found that this program was sufficient, and I have not encountered any issues. The highlight is that its relatively easy to use, even for a beginner coder.</p>
        <p>Slack is excellent for communication from team and managers and I have had no problems whatsoever. It enables me to be constantly informed and I can get any queries or questions I have answered with respectable speed.</p>
        <p>In review I am content with Tools I am using for this project.</p>
