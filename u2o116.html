    <h2>Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>
    <div class="answersBody">
        <p>The web is fundamentally to designed to work for all people and the UN even define access as a basic human right. This is important as the web is becoming an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life including education, employment, healthcare, recreation and more an. It is essential that the web is accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunities to people with diverse abilities.</p>
        <p>Web accessibility includes tools, website and technologies. These are designed so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, interact and contribute to the web. It is worth noting that there is a broad range of disabilities accounted for, however there are groups without disabilities that also benefit from accessibility, whether it be the style of device they use or changes to their abilities due to ageing.</p>
        <p>Overcoming these is most efficient and effective when incorporated at the begging of projects, ensuring it is well understood and integrated within your project and to save time on re-doing work.</p>
