    <h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <div  class="answersBody">
        <p>In review of website, further improvements could be made for accessibility, navigation, and visual experience. Accessibility wise I would ensure that it reads well across all screen sizes and operating systems and ensure its accessible by all, regardless of age, location and disability. The navigation is quite simplistic some further thought could go into this. Visually there could be lots of improvements from the main pages to the smaller details. With less constraint on time and an improved knowledge of CSS this could happen quite easily.</p>
