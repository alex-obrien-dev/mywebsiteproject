<h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? </h2>
<div class="answersBody">
<p>The key to a successful project whether it be digital or not, is the Project Management which can be broken down into phases. The stages are Initiation, Planning, executing and closing.</p>
<p>Initiation is the first phase of the project. This where the idea a is developed and you state exactly what the project is going to deliver and how you are going to do it. This then leads to you forming a team with all the skills necessary to complete the project and ensuring you have right tools and resources whether it be software or anything else identified for the project. You then have an initial meeting with the team and any relevant other parties to set out the project goals, the schedule, and the processes like the how the project will be managed and how to communicate.</p>
<p>The next phase in planning this is where you break the projects down in to tasks and give a time estimation, note any priority tasks and present them in a time order and highlight interdependent tasks. This is usually represented on project management software which the whole team can access and gives a visual guide to the project. Furthermore, this is normally where the tasks are assigned to the relevant parts of the team, noting there may be parts of the team with different skills sets but share interdependent tasks.</p>
<p>After planning is Execution which is where most of the work happens. This is as the name suggests the execution of the plan. Its particularly important in this stage to monitor and control the work and ensure constant communication. Furthermore, its essential to stay on track in terms of the budget, schedule, and quality performance as these are all integral to the success of the project. It’s also worth noting that this is where the project manager really has their work set out in terms of identifying and mitigating risks, problem solving and incorporating any necessary changes.
The final phase is the Closing of the project which must be done carefully to make the most of what has been achieved and ensure that any lessons learnt are noted for any future projects.</p>
<p>It is also worth taking note of the ‘Triple Constraint’ which refers to time, scope and cost. These make up three points of a triangle and constantly influence each other, if there is a setback in one the others will be affected and need to be adjusted.
