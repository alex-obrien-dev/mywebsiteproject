        <p>For the website there were expectations set out. In terms of content, the content I have included is the appropriate outcome for the project and meets expectation. Also expected was the use of appropriate editing and formatting techniques which I used for the clarity and navigation of the website. Although as previous stated I believe further improvement was possible, I believe the outcome is satisfactory at least. Furthermore with testing I have ensures the web pages are error free in terms of content, style and navigation.</p>
