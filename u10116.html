<h2>Describe and provide analysis on how chosen technologies have helped you</h2>
<div class="answersBody">
    <p>The main technologies I have used withing the coding course are; Trello for work management and Slack for communication.</p>
    <p>Trello In my opinion is an excellent software platform that for organisation and management, whether I was in a group project or working independently on a different assignment. Vie the ‘Kanban’ method it allowed you split up the projects in to bit where you could easily sort them to keep track where you and the rest of the group are up to. One of my favourite aspects of it is that it is very easy on the eye and has a simple user friendly lay out and interface. Not knowing about before this course, it is now an essential part of the planning and management process for any project I’m doing.</p>
    <p>My Trello for this project is here;</p>
    <p>Slack was essential for maintaining communication with the rest of the project team and also the Tutor/Manager. The fact that you can see who’s online and receive notifications of any message means communication is quicker, easier and more efficient. Also it proved incredibly useful for sharing resources and seeking help/advice when needed.</p>
