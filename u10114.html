<h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects â€“ what causes digital projects to fail? Why</h2>
<div class="answersBody">
    <p>From a source published in September 2018 it estimated that somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail. This does not just include small companies or new start-ups this also includes giant companies failing at digital transformation. There a multitude of reasons for such a high percentage of failure, the most common problem seems to be collaboration. </p>
    <p>A successful digital project requires significant collaboration and with this even relatively simple problems can stack up against the project leading to failure. Other significant problems seem to be a regularity among failures as well. These are not limited to but  include; Failing to account for business probes, failing to get everyone on-board and which affects committal of resources, Supporting a project because its new and shiny instead of focusing on customer/business led needs, poor definition and expectation setting and lastly poor vendor selection.</p>
    <p>Its clear digital projects are inherently risky, which can be seen as just the nature of innovation. As the role of IT in modern business continues to grow and become entwined in all aspects of the business, this in turn requires greater planning and also greater collaboration than ever before.</p>
